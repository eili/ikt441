Convolutional Neural Networks assignment

The CNN Assignment should be Face recognition. The dataset is available from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
Can you recognize male/female?
Can you recognize individualis? 

A subset of the data is grouped in two folders, male and female. 
Using the Keras library. Sets â…“ of the data as test, rest is training.
